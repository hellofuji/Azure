## Development

This theme uses Gulp and PostCSS for style compilation. Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com)

Setup and development workflow:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build and watch for changes
gulp dev

# Generate distribution ZIP
gulp zip
```

CSS files in `/assets/css/` are automatically compiled to `/assets/built/`. 

The `gulp zip` command packages the theme files into `dist/azure.zip`, ready for upload to your Ghost site.
